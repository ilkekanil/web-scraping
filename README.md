# web-scraping
This Python script scrapes job announcement and application data from kariyer.net for various districts (il√ße) of Istanbul. It utilizes web scraping techniques to fetch job listings, parse HTML content, and extract information such as the total number of job announcements and applications per district. Users can customize the districts of interest by updating the ilce_listesi dictionary in main.py with the corresponding district IDs and names from kariyer.net. The script outputs these statistics to the console, providing insights into regional job market trends within Istanbul. This project is intended for anyone interested in analyzing or monitoring job market dynamics in specific districts of Istanbul based on real-time data from kariyer.net.
